To run:

1. Store these files in the same folder as the "test" and "train" dataset folders
2. Assignment3_NB.py - Naive Bayes without discarding stop words
   Assignment3_NB2.py - Naive Bayes discarding stop words
   Assignment3_LR.py - Logistic regression without discarding stop words
   Assignment3_LR2.py - Logistic regression discarding stop words
3. Naive Bayes - 
	run the files using "python Assignment3_NB.py" or "python Assignment3_NB2.py" on the command line
4. Logistic regression
	need to pass regularization parameter and number of iterations as arguments
	run file using "python <file_name>.py 0.01 50" where 0.01 is the regularization parameter and 50 is the number 	of training epochs or iterations
